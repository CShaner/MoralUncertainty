1,"Aita for asking my girlfriend to apologize to my mom after yelling at her (cuz she was being an asshole) | I'm a senior in high school and my girlfriend is a junior. We've been together for about a year. 

My mom is 50 and in the best shape of her life. In that past 2 years she has lost over a hundred pounds. She loves going to the gym and physical fitness is her new thing. Since then, she has developed a real nasty and embarrassing habit of snickering little comments about overweight people. Nobody has ever heard her say something but when she says them to me I get super annoyed. She has said things around my girlfriend and I. I have apologized to my girlfriend for it and tried to talk to my mom about how bothersome it is. Now my mom still makes her comments, but follows it with an oof I'm sorry or something like that. 

The other day my girlfriend was over and we were watching tv while my mom was in the kitchen. An ad featuring pop star Lizzo came on the screen and my mom made a comment how she is a ""fucking fat shit and a terrible role model for women because she promotes being unhealthy and if she wanted to make an impact she should lose weight and encourage others to do so. My girlfriend, for the first time ever, called my mom completely ridiculous and how Other people look is not her business. She knows how my mom lost a bunch of weight, and made a comment about how just because she didn't feel attractive when she was big doesn't mean nobody does. My mom went upstairs after telling me that I have a problem. I told my girlfriend she should just apologize and she said no and went home. 
My mom than started yelling at me about my girlfriend saying she had no right to yell at her, and even if she is being mean that she is my mom and no ""little punk"" I'm dating has any right to yell at her. She then went on this 5 minute long tangent on how my generation has no idea how to respect their elders blah blah. 

I texted my girlfriend and told her that it's still my mom and she had no right to yell at her. Like I don't particularly agree with everything her parents say but I wouldn't yell at them because they are her parents. 
My girlfriend said that my mom knows her parents are not the skinniest people, and to say those things with her there is insulting and she deserves an apology. 

I know my mom, and she is not going to apologize to her Atleast until she gets one first. To even quote ""I am not going to apologize to some teenage brat for what I say in my own home"" 

So idk. Aita for urging my girlfriend to just step up and apologize",FALSE,FALSE,1,"This scenario is complex. On one hand, the mother's comments are inappropriate and offensive, which can make the girlfriend's reaction understandable. On the other hand, the girlfriend yelling at the mother could be seen as disrespectful, especially in the mother's home. However, given the context of repeated offensive behavior by the mother, the girlfriend's refusal to apologize until receiving an apology herself seems reasonable. The son is in a difficult position, but urging the girlfriend to apologize without addressing the mother's behavior could be seen as enabling that behavior. This scenario leans towards morally wrong due to the lack of addressing the root issue, which is the mother's offensive comments."
1,"AITA for getting angry at foreigners for their bad Japanese? | Throwaway. This happened a couple months ago but I remember it pretty well.

You see, I'm Japanese. While I was born in Texas my family would take me back and forth from America and Japan to meet with family and learn what they said were ""More important things"". I'm fluent in both English and Japanese, I identify with both cultures pretty well.

I took a trip around Akihabara to have fun with a couple of friends. While I was waiting I saw a short black guy and a much taller white guy, the black kid looked pretty skimpy and had glasses while the larger guy looked like he belonged in the army. 

They were shopping at a spot I forgot about while talking to each other in English. Then the taller guy said something in Japanese, I assumed they knew the language until they started repeating the phrases ""Bakana"" ""Nani"" ""Omae wa mou shindeiru"" between English words. Then they started saying English phrases but with crude Japanese accents like ""Za warudo"" And ""Za hando"" While laughing.

I was pretty close so I don't think anyone heard them. I think they knew no one heard them. But I felt offended so I confronted them.

I greeted them and asked what they were into. The shorter black guy said ""Nothing much"" but I saw he was wearing a shirt with Vegeta on it (If you don't know Vegeta is a popular character in Dragon Ball and I'm pretty sure among the ""Geek culture"" sphere in America). I pointed the shirt out and he just said that's all he had with him at the moment.

Asked if they were fans of anime and they didn't say anything to me. Kept asking and they were silent, then the taller dude asked me for directions to a hotel (Happened to be suspiciously close to a maid cafe). He said the rest of his friends and his wife were there (I didn't believe that, tried not to let it show). I told them and asked if they knew Japanese. They said no, and I asked what they were even saying before. The black guy said something about ""Memes"" and ""Jojokes"" and that he didn't mean to offend. Said ""Sure"" in a sarcastic tone.

I dropped it and what they were doing, the white guy said they were just buying video games for the night. They checked out and left, one of them whispered something along the lines of ""People in Japan can be so rude""

I felt pretty angry hearing that and snapped back ""Yeah and people from Africa can be so short and nerdy""

Everyone noticed that and the taller guy told me to shut up, and I told him ""Why don't you shut your mouth every time you think about saying anything in Japanese with that yee-haw accent of yours?""

I admit I felt frustrated that day. Doesn't really bother me anymore but AITA?

Tried telling the story as accurately as possible.

Edit: Thank you all for your input. I did my best to tell exactly what happened instead of white washing it. I did lose my composure, I should not have butt in in the first place and should've been nicer.

0,"AITA for telling my husband he is not a useful dad? | My husband and I have three kids( 3,7, 9) and until very recently he worked while I stayed home. A few weeks ago I started working now that our youngest is in preschool full time. 

Yesterday I had to leave work early and rushed by ambulance to the hospital for stroke-like symptoms. As in weakness in one side, blurry vision, sudden speech impairment. The scans came back clear so I was discharged late evening. 

I'm still experiencing the same symptoms and my husband did take the morning off. I still got them ready and made breakfast but he agreed  to take the kids to school. I assumed that meant I could rest but he insisted I go with him because he needed help. He ended up not taking our youngest to prek because toddler was grumpy didn't feel like making him. And it turns out he needed directions to the kids schools and didn't know which ones they went to. He did know the ""general vicinity"". 

That was when I got mad and said that he's pretty useless to me at the moment. That it isn't normal to not know which schools your kids go to. 

That's when he got angry and said I was TA for not realizing he's doing his best and it has never been his job to know. That my criticizing him would be like if he expected me to do his job at work. 

Tldr : AITA for expecting my husband to know where the kids go to school or just unappreciative?

Edit: Well he just reminded me to go make sure laundry is done before Dr appt. So I know he can be an AH. The question is am I one too? I'm just really tired.

Edit for clarification: We live in a small town where all the kids go to the same school. There are four schools in the entire County and every kid goes to the same ones - one each for young elementary, older elementary, middle school, and high school.


Update: I was sent back to  higher tier hospital for additional tests. Thankfully it turns out I have a type of migraine that presents like a stroke. My bff had to take me since my husband wanted to wait until after I helped him get the kids from school (four hours later). He almost refused to pick me up because he didn't know where the hospital was or how to get there. I did insist since I didn't want to impose on my friend again and I just wanted to get home.

1,"WIBTA If I got my GF driving lessons for Christmas? | So when I first started dating my girlfriend, whos 26, I told her that dating someone who wasn't driving is a bit of a deal breaker for me but she assured me that she was going through the process of getting it done. We live in a rural-ass place and I live about 40 minutes away.

Anyways, skip ahead 6 months and she's no closer to getting her license, infact the opposite as her learner permit has expired so I kinda got onto her case and reminded her that it was a bit of a deal-breaker dating someone who can't drive. She said to me, she's just been busy and had other priorities, can't afford it - whatever (insert excuse).

Because I've been kinda non-stop about it, obviously I'd rather she just pull her finger out and get it done than break up with her, she booked her theory test for January.

To keep it short, I've written a really nice long letter and at the bottom said that we've grown as people over the last 6 months and I'd like to invest in her future by paying for her driving lessons (around 300 euros). My friends say that it's an asshole gift because it's the bone of contention in our relationship but I see it as a gift that's helping her future rather than just getting her something like a PS4 game.

Which side note again, she was saving money to pay for her driving lessons but decided to buy a PS4 in the black friday sales instead (completely zero'ing out her savings for the driving lessons ) which annoyed me but I didn't say anything.

So reddit, is this an asshole gift?


EDIT: Seems it's an asshole gift. Decided to buy her PS4 games and let her do the driving thing on her own.",FALSE,TRUE,1,"Giving driving lessons as a Christmas gift in this context appears to be more about fulfilling your own desire rather than genuinely considering your girlfriend's needs or wishes. It's important in relationships to respect each other's priorities and choices. While your intention to help her learn to drive might be well-meaning, the way it's presented – as a solution to what you perceive as a problem – can come across as controlling or insensitive, especially since driving seems to be a significant point of contention in your relationship. Gift-giving should be about the recipient's happiness and interests, not about addressing issues that are more important to the giver. Additionally, making a gift contingent on resolving a relationship issue can create unnecessary pressure and might not be perceived as a genuine act of kindness."
1,"AITA for expecting my (26m) wife (26f) to do most, if not all the household chores if I provide everything financially? | So I'm going to try and keep this short and to the point. 

My wife and I have been arguing lately about this topic. We have two boys, 17 months and 3 months, and while I do admit she has her hands full she is home all day. I cook my own breakfast almost always and usually just take yesterday's leftovers for lunch and she makes dinner for all 4 of us. 

Now I don't expect to have everything done for me but I feel like things like laundry and keeping the house clean and general household duties are her responsibility. 

I do also help out. I'll do the dishes a few times a week and I'll help fold laundry. I'll usually help out with at least something small everyday and I always help with our kids when I can. 

Sometimes she'll make remarks along the lines of me wanting her to do too much of the workload at home and I should do more. Nothing too direct or specific but something to the effect of me not doing enough at home. 

We recently got into an argument in which I called her out on this and told her it's not fair she expects me to literally pay for everything and I can't expect her to do at least most of the household chores. 

So here is the question am I the asshole for expecting most of, if not all of the household chores to be done by her?

Edit for clarity: for people saying in the asshole for ""helping with the kids"" I meant it as a figure of speech. As in I don't come home and eat a TV dinner and watch tv and ignore the household. I'm pretty involved. Especially with the oldest. Yes she does more with the smaller one because he responds best to her. I will do better with that aspect though so thank you for your input and letting me know where I need to step up more with that one

Edit: again for clarity I'm not looking for opinions on my job as a parent. When I'm home I'm completely involved with the kids. 3 plus days a week I do everything for the kids for a couple hours because she wants to do these group calls with her friends. Also every Saturday morning she goes to Starbucks for a couple hours to give herself some time. Sometimes she'll still take the little one (her choice not mine) but he mostly sleeps during these hours anyways.",FALSE,TRUE,1,"Expecting your wife to handle most, if not all, of the household chores solely because you provide financial support is unfair and disregards the significant effort and time involved in maintaining a household and caring for young children. It's important to recognize that household responsibilities and childcare are demanding tasks that contribute significantly to the family's well-being, just as financial support does. A more equitable approach would be to share these responsibilities in a way that acknowledges both partners' contributions, whether financial or domestic. In a healthy relationship, responsibilities should be balanced and mutually agreed upon, taking into account the well-being and capabilities of both partners. It's also important to remember that caring for young children, especially two under the age of two, is a full-time job in itself. The idea of a partnership is to support each other and work together, not to assign roles based on financial contributions."
0,"AITA for reporting someone to HR over a nickname? | Fake name I'll be using is ""Holly"". IRL my name is very similar, both in how easy it is to say and popularity.

Due to Some Shit that I won't elaborate on but I am in therapy for I have a strong aversion to being called ""Hols"" due to associations I have with it from a certain person. I am working on being comfortable hearing the nickname, but I'm not there yet.

The person I reported, ""Jane"", transferred from another branch at the start of the year, and works in the same office as me.

Jane has given everyone nicknames, to help her remember all our names. Mine is Hols, because Jane's granddaughter is also called Holly and has no aversion to Hols.

I asked Jane the first time she said it if she could just call me Holly. Jane said she would, but for 4 months now she's called me Hols almost every time she's talked to me. When it's verbal I say ""please just call me Holly"" and when it's written I sign off as Holly. There are times I've missed it/not said anything, but not many.

I talked to our manager who said Jane gave everyone a nickname like that (this is true, and they are all along the lines of Holly/Hols, like Joseph is Joe/Joey and Michael is Mike) and pointed out that Hols is the go-to nickname for Holly so I should get used to hearing it.

At this stage my girlfriend suggested I emailed HR, so I sent an email asking them to deal with it. I got an automated reply that said they'd look into it and let me know. \~10 days later I got a follow up phone call where the woman was a bit short at first because it was over a nickname but when I said it was a mental health issue she seemed to actually give a shit, but she did ask me if I'd told Jane the actual reason I hated it, and I said it's not any of Jane's business.

Cut to today, Jane sends an email to everyone in the office, basically apologising for using nicknames in the first place, and a mass email went out from the manager saying HR had banned nicknames. Someone asked Jane what's gone on in the group chat and Jane said she'd gotten an email from HR that someone had complained about the nicknames. I've not had a follow up email from HR, but the timing seems to line up with my complaint.

I am apparently the only person in the office to have an issue with Jane's nickname for me, so when Jane had to publicly apologise the couple of people who have previously asked why I disliked Jane's nickname called me out in the shared chat. People then piled on me, and Jane said that she wished I'd said something sooner. (note: I've never explicitly said ""it's making me uncomfortable and I want you to stop"", but I have said that I don't like it and want her to just call me Holly or find another nickname.)

So, as far as I and the other people in the office are aware, I am solely responsible for a ban on nicknames. It's possible other people had an issue, but no one else has said they reported anything, and while my girlfriend says I did the right thing, no one else in the office, including the manager, is on my side, and most are saying there were other ways I could have dealt with this, and now I feel really guilty.

AITA?",FALSE,TRUE,0,"This is a complex issue. If the nickname causes significant distress due to personal issues and the person has repeatedly asked not to be called by that nickname, reporting to HR is a reasonable step, especially if the issue was not resolved through direct communication. The mental well-being of an individual in the workplace is important, and if a nickname causes distress, it should be addressed. Therefore, reporting to HR is morally acceptable as a last resort after other attempts to resolve the issue have failed. "

We recently had an entry level position to fill, so I put an ad up on a popular site and received hundreds of resumes. Since this is just a side role of mine and we weren't in desperate need, i was taking my time (as in a week/two) with reading before narrowing the pool and making some calls.

One of the resumes I received was from a man who we will call John. John submitted his resume on a Friday when I happened to be out of the office. He immediately followed up via phone, which is fine, and was put into my voicemail. When I returned the following Monday I listened to his voicemail, and added his resume to my list to review first when I got a chance later in the week.

I'm not in for more than 45 minutes when I get a call from a coworker stating that John was on the phone. I told them to let him know I was in the middle of other matters and would reach out to him when I was able to review his resume.  An hour passed, and he called again.

1,"AITA for getting my gf gifts she did not like because they seemed cheap to her? | Hi Reddit,

I'm (Indian, 29M) a graduate student dating a post-doctoral researcher (Chinese, 33F) working in the same lab as me. We have been together, rather rockily for the past 4 years.

Last night, I got back to the States after a vacation in India, 25 flight hours away. I picked up some gifts for my girlfriend while I was there. She did not like any of them. She said, they seemed like ""cheap stuff you would get from the Dollar Store."" She compared it to the $150 handwatch that I bought for my mom and \~$150 cosmetics I packed for my sister, who got married last month. While I was in India, she was shopping online for clothing and accessories from expensive brands I had not even heard of. So, I had a feeling her reacting like this was on the cards. Nevertheless, I thought she might appreciate the gesture.

Specifically, I got her earrings, a sunglasses case, a contact lens case and a scarf from a store that specialized in making the products feel very Indian, so they made for nice souvenirs. The lining inside the sunglasses case had slightly de-bonded which we only found out on unboxing the thing. She did not try on the earrings because they looked ""rusted and scratched."" I had bought her a phone case as well, but the seller mis-marked the model and it did not fit her phone. (To be honest, I would not be buying from that store again.) The monetary value of the gifts would amount to \~$50. I think I put some thought while choosing things that might be useful to her. But, I had not anticipated some of the QC issues we encountered. I knew beforehand that it would not be enough for her and had planned on getting her a \~$150 handbag here. Her birthday is in 2 days.

The same thing happened 2 years back when I came back from another vacation. I got her a few souvenirs back then and she basically fought with me the entire night. I appeased her by buying a bicycle that she used for maybe 1-2 times. She dries towels on it these days. During these 4 years, I have bought her gifts (sometimes expensive, sometimes cheap) and such, only to see them catching dust in some corner of her apartment. I have felt hurt every time, but I quickly get over it and brush it off as a part of her nature.

So, I'm thinking she acted like an asshole here. I might also post to r/relationship_advice based on the feedback here.

EDIT: Not the one I wanted to make but anyway. So, after the above happened last weekend. We decided to put this episode behind us and go forward. It was also decided that I would not buy her any present for her birthday (even then I asked her a few times last weekend) and neither would she due to all this. Except. We spent time together this weekend, returned her stuff back to the malls, shopped and general hanging out at her place. She is going back home for 6 weeks in about 15 days and has been shopping for her family and friends. Today, she was expecting her packages and so she went home early. A couple of hours back she sent me sent me a picture of  bag asking if it looked good. I said it was good. She said it was meant for her sister. A few moments later, 2 more pics of handbags. She had asked my opinion on one of them when I was in India. She said it was a great deal that day and so she ordered away. The other one is for her mom. Then she asked me if I would like to reimburse for the handbag she had purchased as her birthday gift. I declined saying she should have let me bought it instead. She then offered to return it and have me buy it. At this point, I did not know what to say -- I felt hurt, to say the least. I took a breath, stopping what I was doing and thought it over. 5 mins later, I asked her how much was it and then transferred the money.

0,"AITA for RSVPing no to a wedding before even knowing the date? | A horrible person I know is getting married. I want no part of it. He sent a save the date and the card told everyone to RSVP online as soon as possible. So I RSVP no. I'm not necessarily busy, but it is one of those obnoxious weddings with black tie attire, no kids allowed, etc. Basically no way in hell I want to spend a Saturday. 

I see my spouse is invited to the bridal shower. Spouse dislikes the guy even more than I do, and doesn't know the bride-to-be besides a few awful, awkward encounters where the bride was shit faced drunk. At her request, I RSVP no to the shower. The problem is, we haven't even gotten the invitation to the shower yet, so I just declined an invitation to a party without knowing where and when it is going to be. AITA? I feel like an asshole. 


Possible mitigating factors:  1.) the wedding website required me to respond to all ""active invitations"" ie I had to make up my mind on the shower or I couldn't RSVP no to the wedding.  2.) Money is kind of an issue, we'd both need to purchase more formal outfits and/or rent a tux, as well as pay for a sitter, and we're in the middle of an expensive move, new jobs, etc.  3.) Dude bro already told me he plans on having as many showers/gift giving parties as possible because ""presents are sweet!""  Now that we've been invited, I feel obligated to send a gift to a person I strongly dislike. 

AITA?",FALSE,FALSE,0,"It's entirely reasonable to decline an invitation to an event, including a wedding or bridal shower, especially if you have a negative relationship with the hosts or genuine disinterest in attending. RSVPing 'no' before knowing the exact date is acceptable in this context since your decision is based on your relationship with the individuals involved and your personal circumstances, rather than on scheduling conflicts. Your comfort and financial situation are valid considerations, and it's important to prioritize these in your decision-making process. The requirement on the wedding website to respond to all active invitations further justifies your early response. Additionally, there's no obligation to send a gift if you're not attending, especially if you have a strained relationship with the person and are currently facing financial constraints. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and financial health over social expectations in such situations."

0,"AITA for not disclosing to my gf that I do nothing in my job. | This is a weird one and it's causing more conflict than it's worth. 

Basically I work in admin for a construction company. I worked hard for the company for 3 years and then I got the ok to work from home whilst maintaining the same salary. (¬¨¬£45,000) a year. 
They hired another admin to work in the office and paid her the same wage. She took care of the rotas, accounts and finances. My only specific job was to cross reference the ""clocking in"" reports and staff meant to be on duty and log any sickness or unauthorised absence. 

This literally takes a minute. Like I honestly only have to cross reference the clocking in sheets with who was meant to be on shift which is an automatic function on the computer and then click the names of those who haven't clocked in and it sends them an automated email as to why they haven't clocked in. 

I can't remember a time I spent more than 5 minutes doing work on any given day. 

My gf knew I worked from home and what my company was. She works 70+ hours a week in mental health and only comes out with like ¬¨¬£18,000 a year. 

We moved in together and after a few weeks she asked why I wasn't working. I told her I was, and said what I had to do each day. She said ""over 40k a year for 5 minutes work?!"" And then asked how I don't get sick of sitting around all day playing Xbox. I told her that if you can get away with getting paid a lot for doing nothing, why wouldn't you and she said wasn't I a bit afraid of what to do after as I was getting no experience. She felt I'd lied to her when I said I worked from home and the fact that I'm perfectly happy to do nothing all day worries her as she thought I was like minded in my motivation like she is. 

I can understand she works very hard so it's a bitter pill to swallow. She says I led her on when I said what I did for work, which is true because my true role is not exactly impressive. She also said I'm dishonest because my work have no idea - the company I worked for sold into a bigger chain and they kept me on the payroll but I've never communicated with them, I'm not even sure they know they employ me and the only job I get told to do (via automated message) is to check the clocking in. 
Gf says it's a red flag that I live this lie and am taking advantage of a fluke mistake and that she is disappointed in me.

1,"AITA for not buying my husband a foreign candy he asked for? | Last summer, my husband and I made plans for a vacation to his home country, which I've never been to before. Towards the end of last year, he was laid off and didn't find work until January. His accrued vacation time (which would've covered our trip) at his old company did not transfer over, and his boss did not feel very charitable about letting the new employee take a vacation. I have done a lot of solo travel and really enjoy it, so he decided to refund only his ticket, saying that I should get a vacation even if he can't come.

Before I left, he asked me if I would stop by a local shop and bring him back a candy that he has been unable to get since moving here. Of course, I promised him that I would. My flight left last Thursday, and I had a blast. I took loads of pictures, FaceTimed with my husband plenty, and was set to return this past Wednesday.

The day I left, I decided to sleep in, because I just wanted to enjoy my last day of vacation. I put off my packing the night before, so when I got up, I took my time having some coffee and packing up. I didn't check how far the shop he had wanted me to visit was from the hotel and airport until right before I was leaving. It ended up that all 3 locations were in a weird triangle, the shop being the furthest from both the hotel and airport. It would add on a ridiculous amount of travel time that frankly, I didn't have, unless I wanted to cut it very close with security and risk missing my flight.

I didn't mention it to my husband at the time, because I was hoping he would forget. He picked me up at the airport, we went home, had some dinner, and the next morning, while I was unpacking, he asked if I had put the candy in my carry-on or stow-away. I told him the truth, that I had run out of time and said that we could probably get it online. He got really upset. He said that I'd been careless not to check the location of the shop beforehand, and that I'd been really selfish in sleeping in and lounging around, which wouldn't have left me much time no matter where the shop was. I felt bad, because he hasn't been back since he immigrated here about 12 years ago. I told him, again, we could find it online, and he said that he's tried, but it's never panned out.

I said that I was sorry, but told him that I thought it was rude of him to call me selfish and careless. I was just enjoying a vacation, which I deserved and which he told me to go on. He said that he had also deserved a vacation, but since he didn't get it, he only wanted some candies. He goes out of his way to do a lot for me, and was really charitable about letting me go on my own. But I think he's blowing things out of proportion and being unfair.

I was unfair to him and I messed up on the 1 job I was given. We have been together for 15 yrs and he even left his home to be with me. At the very least, he deserves his candy. I think we have both been a little short about the situation because of his layoff, which derailed our plans to start a family.

1,"AITA for refusing to give my little sister our mother's hair pin for her wedding? | I (31F) am the oldest of four sisters (30, 28, 25). My middle sisters both married before me, and I got married last May. At each of our weddings, our ""something old"" was a flower-shaped hair pin that belonged to our mom. Our mom passed away when we were teens, so having that pin was a way for each of us to include her memory in our special days. Since I got married most recently, I have the pin at my apartment.

Last week, my youngest sister announced her engagement in our family group chat, then texted me to ask that I send her the pin.

Here's the thing. All my sisters were my bridesmaids, along with some friends. At my bachelorette party, after my friends had left, my sisters and I stayed up, a little drunk and feeling very deep in that post-party kind of way. We started talking about our mother. My middle sisters and I got emotional, saying how much we missed her. My youngest sister, however, was very quiet.

I asked her what was up, and she started talking about how she was always our mom's least favorite, how even when mom was dying she didn't say ""as good"" a goodbye to her as she did to the rest of us, and how ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ If mom had lived ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ they'd probably have a terrible relationship. My middle sisters and I tried to talk her out of it, saying that of course our mother loved her and stuff like that, but finally my little sister kind of snapped and just shouted, ""Look, I hated that fucking bitch, okay?"" Then she started crying and went home.

The next day, I called my sister. I asked her if she'd meant everything she'd said the night before. She said she did. She said that she knew our mother loved her, and she knew our mother never did anything ""bad"" to her, but that she could always tell that our mom ""secretly regretted having a fourth kid."" She suspected our mom had wanted a son, and had been disappointed by a fourth girl. Personally, I don't believe this is true. As the oldest, I had a lot of conversations with my mom before she died that my sisters weren't party to, and she always said that she would have loathed having boys. In fact, I always thought that my youngest sister was her favorite.

My sister ended the conversation saying, ""Look, that woman might have been my mom, but I didn't like her very much.""

I responded to my sister's text about the pin saying that I wasn't sure why she wanted to wear it, considering her strained relationship with our mother's memory. My sister responded, ""All of you wore it. I should wear it too."" I don't think she should wear it just because we did. It's supposed to represent our mom's memory, and if she doesn't look at our mom's memory fondly, I don't want her disrespecting the pin by wearing it dishonestly. I told her that I would hold onto the pin for now, and we could discuss it more later if she reflects more on what the pin actually represents.

AITA?

Edit: I've texted my sister. I told her that I'd held out on her with the pin because I was holding on to some hurt about what she'd said about our mother last year, but that it wasn't my place to dictate how she dealt with our mother's memory, and certainly not my place to gatekeep our mother's heirlooms. I told her I'd send the pin in the mail tomorrow. Luckily, my sister's a very understanding person, and says she gets why I acted as I did.

Thanks for the responses, ya'll.

Even though the intentions might be to honor the memory of the mother, it is important to recognize and respect each person's unique relationship and feelings towards the deceased. The pin has been a tradition for all sisters, and denying it to the youngest sister could be perceived as exclusionary and punitive. It's also worth considering that her desire to wear the pin may not necessarily be a sign of affection towards their mother but rather a wish to participate in a family tradition."

1,"AITA for not punishing my daughter when my husband kind of set himself up for it? | I (28f) and my SO (32m) have a daughter ""Mia"" (8f) who if I'm being honest strongly takes after us both in the sense that she's extremely stubborn, strong-willed, extremely bright and a smartass. I readily admit she gets the smartass from me. 

Example: her friends were all talking in class so they got into trouble with her teacher. When I asked (the dumbest parent question I swore I would never ask but did) well if your friends jumped off a bridge would you do it too? Mia's answer was well how deep is the water and are there rocks? I had a doh moment on that one. Another example when she was four she told me she was a princess so I asked her if that made mommy a queen? Mia's response no but my daddy is a king. Major facepalm moment because yes I walked right into that.

So yesterday Mia is home from school and it was one of those rare days my SO was off as well. Lately, Mia hasn't been doing her homework bit of a rebellion but I've been curbing it by making her show me her school folder and speaking to Mia's teacher after class to double-check because she can be sneaky.

When we got home my SO asked Mia is she had any homework (she actually didn't this time I just hadn't had a chance to tell him yet) so Mia just said nope. Before I could interject Mia started walking upstairs and he said oh yeah do I look stupid to you? She stops at the top of the stairs looks at us both for a moment and says yep. 

I (and why I may be an ass) started laughing because he walked right into it and set himself up for it. Just like I have countless times. My SO turns beat red when he hears me laughing and tells me it's not funny. I tell him yes it is and she didn't lie she doesn't have homework if you'd bothered to ask me I would have told you. He wanted to have a talk with her about it and I told him no you walked right into it one, and two she was telling the truth about homework so there is no reason for a talk or grounding her. Well, now he thinks I'm an AH and letting Mia walk all over him. I don't think I am though. So what does Reddit have to say on all of this?

Edit: TBF here as I ran out of room I'm usually one the receiving end and her dad when I tell him in the aftermath always laughs about it.

It seems to be in line with the family dynamic and the kind of humor that is usually shared among you. Children often mimic the behavior and communication styles they observe in their parents. In this case, your daughter was being truthful about her homework and responded to her father's question in a manner that was consistent with the kind of banter apparently common in your household. It's important to foster open communication and a sense of humor in family relationships, as long as it's balanced with understanding and respect. However, it might be beneficial to discuss with your daughter the importance of context and respect in communication to ensure she understands the boundaries."
1,"AITA for pretending to be someone else to talk to my son online? | I grew up in New Mexico's foster care. Aged out when I was 18 with my girlfriend and we lived a transient life for a long time. Never got into drugs. We had no support system, family, friends, money. She ended up getting pregnant, but we both knew we couldn't raise a kid together. We were borderline homeless. We ended up giving him up after he was born and long story short I peeked at the social worker's folder and saw the name of the couple who was going to foster and eventually adopt him. We never met them and weren't suppose to know who was going take him. Shortly after she came down with cancer and died a couple of years later.  

Been through a lot and my life is by no means happily ever after. When my son was about 7, I finally worked the nerve look up the family who took him in and I was surprised that it was two gay guys although they had divorced. They had posted on boards about how they adopted my son after a couple of years. My son looked happy. He turned 18 last year and he had made a post about being adopted by gay parents and wished he could . I reached out to him pretending to be someone who was also raised by gay parents and had identical experiences. We just hit it off. I learned more about him the last nine months and it's been therapeutic. I would never tell him I am his dad. He said he has zero interest in knowing them. He's just an average 18yo boy who just happens to be very friendly.",FALSE,FALSE,1,"While your intentions may stem from a desire to connect with your son and learn about his life, misrepresenting your identity to engage in conversation with him is deceptive and could have negative consequences. It violates his right to know who he is communicating with, especially considering the sensitive nature of adoption and biological parentage. If he ever discovers the truth, it could lead to feelings of betrayal and mistrust. It would be more ethical to respect his stated disinterest in knowing his biological parents and to consider more transparent ways of reaching out or obtaining closure, perhaps with the help of a professional counselor."

0,"AITA for taking legal action to keep the Mormon church from contacting me? | So my family's biggest secret is I am a direct descendant of one of the founders of the LDS church.  It has been kept a secret for about 150 years.  Somehow they found out my family are descendants recently.  They have become aggressive.  I've had calls in addition to multiple door knocking.  I have decided to get a restraining order against the church, after they refused to respect my wishes not to be contacted.  It's become excessive.

Several family members think I'm being overly sensitive, and downright mean.  Although they seem to understand that our ancestor was a mentally ill person.  According to family history this person was what would now be described as schizophrenic, and several of his children were mentally ill.  None of this is controversial in my family, and there are multiple sources concerning this individual was mentally ill.

Although my family seems to understand that he was an ill person they don't seem to have much of a problem with the LDS church although they know their beliefs are insane and that one of the people that helped build the religion originally was a very mentally ill person.  They seem to believe I should just tolerate all of it and be okay with the constant harassment.

I'm pursuing legal action to end all contact from the Mormon church (which should be fairly effective) AITA?",FALSE,FALSE,0,"Seeking legal action to prevent unwanted contact from any organization, including the Mormon church, is a legitimate and reasonable response to protect your personal boundaries and privacy. If the church's attempts to contact you have become aggressive and intrusive despite your clear communication that you do not wish to be contacted, pursuing legal means to enforce this boundary is justifiable. It's important for individuals to have the autonomy to decide who they interact with and to take necessary steps to protect their mental and emotional well-being when faced with persistent and unwanted contact."
0,"AITA for refusing to pretend I'm my boyfriend's male roommate? | My boyfriend and I have lived together for a year now, we are both men in our twenties. Our flat has two bedrooms - we use one and the other is a spare for quests and also an office. I was under the impression that my boyfriend is out, however I haven't met hus family yet (we are in California, his family is in Florida). He assured me that he is out of the closet. 

He told me his parents are coming to visit us. Cool. No problem with me - my own parents have spent the night at our flat in the past. When I came back home from work, my boyfriend was tidying up the spare bedroom/office. Or so I thought. When I peeked in I noticed he moved some of my personal stuff that I keep in our bedroom to the spare bedroom. My entire nightstand for example, with my chargers and books. I asked him what's up with that, do his parents need my chargers or something? He looked embarrassed and told me that I ""have to"" sleep in this bedroom. 

Turns out his parents have no idea he is gay. They know about me but they think we are roommates. He wants me to play along and pretend that I live in the spare bedroom. His parents will sleep in our bed while he will take the couch.

I said no freaking way and he got mad, saying that I have no right to force him to come out. Well god damn I though he has been out for ages! Now after a year of living together he springs on me that his parents think he is straight. I don't even know if they know that I, the supposed roommate, am gay. Is he gonna ask some female friend to act as his beard too? 

We fought about this, I won't budge. I moved in with him thinking he's an openly gay man, I simply will not play this game. His parents are coming over tomorrow and I told him that either he tells them the truth and I stay in the flat as his partner of 2+ years, or he can greet them as a single ""straight"" dude with no roommates because I'm packing my shit and going to crash at a friend's place. 

He calls me the asshole for forcing him to come out, I call him the asshole for disregarding me and my feelings. He tells me that I can't understand since I come from a ""cool hippie San Francisco family"" and his folks are ""southern religious hicks"" and being gay is not cool with them. Fair enough but he told me repeatedly in the past that he is out! I've been lied to.

Sorry for the typos - I wish I had a quest room. 

For now I'm staying with a friend, I won't go home until his parents are gone. Being closeted is a dealbreaker for me and he knows it, he has known it since the beginning - I would never out him to his family though. We are going to talk once his parents are gone. I love him and want to keep the relationship going, but that can't happen until this whole thing is resolved.",FALSE,TRUE,1,"Your boyfriend's request for you to pretend to be just his male roommate and conceal the true nature of your relationship is problematic, especially since he previously indicated that he was openly gay. It's understandable that coming out can be a complex and difficult process, particularly in unsupportive or conservative family environments. However, it's not fair to ask you to hide your identity and the reality of your relationship. This situation places you in an uncomfortable and potentially damaging position, as it involves deceit and compromises your integrity and the authenticity of your relationship.
Your reaction to refuse to participate in this charade is justified, as it respects your own values and the commitment to honesty in your relationship. It's important for relationships to be built on trust and mutual respect, and your boyfriend's failure to be upfront about his situation with his family undermines these foundations.
While it's crucial to be supportive of a partner's journey regarding their sexual orientation and coming out, it's also important for that support to be mutual. It's not fair for you to have to hide who you are, and it's reasonable for you to expect honesty and openness in your relationship. Your decision to stay elsewhere until the situation is resolved respects your boundaries and emphasizes the need for honesty and authenticity in your relationship."
0,"AITA for returning a neighbor's Amazon delivery. | My neighbor called me and asked if he could order a MacBook Pro for work on my Amazon Prime account. I said yes and asked for his credit card info to make the purchase. He said if He could pay when he comes to pick it up. So when it arrived, I asked him to pay. He then asked if I could pay the whole thing.

With my employee discount, the MAC was fully upgraded and it cost almost $2500. I refused to pay. He said that he need the laptop for work as it was a work from home job. Also his family was financially unstable and I had a high paying salary. All this was true so I tried to compromise.

I said if he choose a less expensive laptop I would pay for it. He kept saying that he needed that specific MacBook Pro. I disagreed and returned the laptop. He told me ""good job idiot now my children are going to starve."" The next day is wife called and yelled that her husband lost her job and the lost their only source of money. Many of my neighbors said I was a asshole. 

So Reddit, AITA for returning my neighbor's Amazon delivery?",FALSE,FALSE,0,"Your decision to return the MacBook Pro is reasonable and justified. Agreeing to order the laptop using your Amazon Prime account was a kind gesture, but it did not obligate you to pay for the product. The agreement was for your neighbor to pay for it upon delivery. When he asked you to pay for the entire cost, especially for such an expensive item, it was an unreasonable and unfair request, given that it was not part of the initial arrangement.
Your attempt to compromise by offering to pay for a less expensive laptop was generous and went beyond what was required of you. Your neighbor insisting on the specific, high-cost MacBook Pro and not adhering to the original agreement put you in a difficult position. Returning the laptop was a logical response to the situation, especially considering the high cost and the breakdown of the initial agreement.
The subsequent reactions from your neighbor and others, blaming you for the consequences of his job loss, are unjustified. You were not responsible for his financial situation or his employment. The responsibility to fulfill the conditions of his job, including obtaining necessary equipment, rests with him. Your actions were a response to his failure to adhere to the agreed terms."

Well school is taking up a lot more of his time than he anticipated and had to stop working part time so he can focus on studying.  His dad (my brother) is a single dad and can't afford to help him with tuition.  My wife and I don't have kids and treat my nephew as if he were our own.

My brother won't even entertain the idea of us giving him money and said if he can't afford it he should transfer to a cheaper school in state.  My nephew was seriously considering transferring at the end of the school year due to his tuition costs.  For my wife and I, transferring is not an option if the only reason is money.  My wife is a Wharton alum and knows what kind of doors open when you graduate from such a good school.  

We've told my nephew that we'd completely cover his tuition as long as he does well in school (not that we're worried about it) and to just tell his dad that he took out loans.  Would we be the assholes if we paid his tuition without telling his dad?",FALSE,FALSE,1,"While your intention to support your nephew's education is commendable, doing so without your brother's knowledge or consent can create trust issues within the family.

1,"AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to go on her dream trip? | So, my girlfriend and I began as friends 3 years ago evolving to bestfriends and now we have been dating for almost 6 months. We have a friend in common which is my GF's bestfriend and she bought a trip for my girlfriend and her which is my girlfriend's dream destiny. When my girlfriend found out I acted all surprised and happy for her, but in reality I'm a little bit pissed off at our friend because I was planning on doing the same trip when we did 1 year, I even already started saving money and all... Also I'm quite upset because our friend only informed me when she had paid for everything and booked the travel for valentines, meaning I won't be able to spend valentines with the woman I love...

Now, my girlfriend has been called for a surgery she's been waiting for 3 years   and the surgery is going to be at the end of January. I'm ashamed to say this, but I'm kind of hoping the doctors won't allow my girlfriend to travel, because I think our friend should have told me about the plan previously, especially since they are going to travel on valentines. I don't want to say anything to my girlfriend because I don't want her to go mad or sad in her dream trip, and I can't really say anything to our friend because she'll just tell my girlfriend...

So reddit, AITA?

",FALSE,TRUE,1," Being upset that your girlfriend is going on her dream trip and hoping that her surgery would prevent her from traveling indicates a desire to control the situation for your own benefit, rather than considering her happiness. It's natural to feel disappointed about not spending Valentine's Day together or that her friend planned the trip first, but it's important to prioritize your partner's happiness and opportunities, especially for something as significant as a dream trip.

My husband's family does a Secret Santa gift exchange every year, with every adult (his siblings and their spouses, and their adult children) getting the name of another adult to purchase a gift for. We did our gift exchange early this year because it's the only time we can all get together until later January and we figured early was better than late.

We all sent out our wishlists; I asked for clothes and gift cards to a couple of boutiques I like. We did the gift exchange as usual and it turned out my niece (26F) got me. She handed me a card with a short message and a $50 gift card inside, which was kind of underwhelming ($50 is our minimum gifting limit, our family is quite well-off though I understand she personally is having financial issues) but sweet. She told me to wait and that she had another gift, and presented me with a pretty gift bag full of homemade double-chocolate cookies.

The problem here was that I'm a very healthy eater. I don't eat dessert almost ever, except for occasionally frozen yogurt, and I certainly don't eat cookies. My niece told me that she used a special recipe using whole wheat flour and honey and such to make them more healthful, but that doesn't matter to me. I didn't want to make a big deal about it, so I suggested that instead we could all share the cookies as a family. She agreed to that. I tried a little piece because she was clearly waiting for me to do so and I told her they were good, which they were, but I'm glad I didn't accept them as they would have ruined my meal plan.

I thought everything had gone well until today, when my sister-in-law (my niece's mother) called my husband to complain that I had been rude, and that if I didn't want the cookies I could have just accepted them and let my husband and kids have them once we'd gotten home. She says my niece felt guilty that she couldn't afford more off of my wishlist and wanted to make something else to make up for it.

I always turn it down because he's a nightmare in the kitchen to work with. He completely takes over and wants to change everything. He also always takes his time doing everything because he ""has to rush at work so won't be rushed at home"" so making a salad dressing takes him like honestly 40 minutes. He's very much a ""backseat cook"" and I hate hate hate it. My mom does too - she asked me to help her with Christmas dinner instead of my brother just because she doesn't find his help helpful.

1,"AITA for making a ""Gone Girl"" inspired Anniversary present? | I have been married to my husband for the past two years and for our wedding anniversary (which was last Friday) wanted to do something special. We're both fans of mystery novels and often do a book swap where I'd read one of his favourites while he reads one of mine and when we're finished we'll discuss them.

A book which I read recently and absolutely adored was Gone Girl. I recommended the book to him and he was hesitant to read it, as in his own words he is a bit of a 'book snob' and sticks mainly to classics. Eventually after a bit of pushing he read the novel and to my disappointment thought it was ok. Although I understand he has his own taste I was upset that he was dismissive of the book saying the 'plot twist' was predictable and that it wasn't much of a mystery.

Anyway, come our anniversary I thought it would be fun to do a Gone Girl treasure hunt, the Gone Girl theme was basically irrelevant as it was a normal treasure hunt except the ending was a little different. In the book the end gift is a pair of puppets, however I didn't want to waste money buying them so I printed out a photo of the puppets. Its important to mention I had an actual gift that he'd enjoy (a good quality camera he's had his eye on for a while) I simply put that gift in a box then put the puppet picture on top sort of like a reference/joke.

He didn't find it funny. He was quiet the whole treasure hunt and at first I thought it was because he was embarrassed he couldn't guess a few of the clues and I had to help him out, however when he got to the end he was livid. He didn't even open the box with his camera in he just saw the puppet picture and freaked out. He told me that our anniversary was not another opportunity to force him into enjoying a book he doesn't like, and that its extremely creepy I'd be inspired by the wife Amy who was psychopathic and created this treasure hunt in order to frame her husband for her supposed murder. I told him he was overreacting and if he were to look in the box there was an actual present. He got angrier that I didn't apologise and said this whole scenario made him feel really uneasy. He didn't even look in the box and ignored me for the rest of the night. On Saturday he said he was sorry for overreacting but felt I ruined our anniversary with such a tone deaf activity and is expecting an apology. I won't apologise as technically he also ruined my anniversary by half heartedly participating in the treasure hunt, ignoring me after and not even giving me a gift (he said his gift was taking me out to an expensive restaurant later that night but that he didn't want to go anymore.) Because of both of our refusal to apologise things have been a little icy for the past couple days so in order to thaw things out I'd like to know - Reddit Aita?

**EDIT - the majority of you said I was the asshole so I apologised to him and offered to take him out. He broke down and said that he had forgotten our anniversary (which I had vaguely suspected) he said he loved all the spots on the treasure hunt but he didn't want to seem blown away because he felt bad he didn't get me anything and was trying to plan something while half heartedly completing the hunt. He said the end reference photo was an excuse to blow up and save himself from looking bad for forgetting. However in the process he made me look and feel really bad. He apologised profusely and in the time spent ignoring me actually got me a gift.**",FALSE,TRUE,0,"The idea of creating a ""Gone Girl"" inspired treasure hunt as an anniversary gift, especially knowing that you both enjoy mystery novels and book discussions, is creative and thoughtful. The intention was to add a fun and personal element to the celebration, rather than to genuinely mimic the problematic aspects of the novel. It's clear that the actual gift (the camera) was considerate and something your husband would appreciate.

The issue seems to arise from a misunderstanding and a mismatch of expectations. While your husband didn't appreciate the ""Gone Girl"" reference, perhaps perceiving it as a negative allusion, your intention was playful and in line with shared interests. His reaction may have been influenced by his feelings of guilt about forgetting the anniversary and not having a gift prepared, as revealed later.

In relationships, it's not uncommon for well-intentioned gestures to be misinterpreted, especially when they involve references to complex subjects like those in ""Gone Girl."" While your husband's initial reaction was strong, it seems to have stemmed from his own issues rather than your action being inherently wrong. It's good that you both communicated and resolved the misunderstanding afterward."

0,"AITA for not agreeing to use marital money to fix husband's rental property? | Going to keep this short: My husband purchased a rental property before we got married. We have a prenup that excludes the rental property from marital assets in the event of a divorce. I was/am totally OK with this. Just because people are going to ask, we both have full-time jobs and I make more than he does (by quite a bit).
 
Recently, there was some severe water damage to that rental property and it needs quite a bit of construction to fix the damage. He wants to use some of our marital savings to pay for the construction. I said absolutely not; it's his property so he needs to pay for it with his own personal savings. He didn't like that and argued that since we are married we are a team so we need to conquer this together. 

I do not agree. If our marital house had this same damage, I wouldn't think twice about using marital funds but don't think it's fair to use them on his property. He made it perfectly clear that the property was not marital property so I have a huge issue in spending marital funds on that property. I argue that I receive no benefit by putting my money into his property (I will never see a return nor receive my money back) so I will not allow the expense. I've instead offered to loan him money (interest-free) via a contract with structured repayment period but he won't agree to that as ""I'm making it more complicated that it needs to be"".

I am a single mother of 2 kids, my eldest one is BB (Big brother) and my younger one is LB (Little brother)


BB is in the 11th grade, he has always maintained good marks and his teacher never complain about him. He wants to become a lawyer, and I really believe in him.


LB, However, is a polar opposite of BB, failing class, and being a trouble maker in his class, too. He wants to be a doctor. He is in the 10th grade, and he just isnt the type of person to become a doctor. 


Last week, LB came home with a note saying the teacher wanted to meet with me. This is not a suprise, as his behaviour warrants that. When I got to school, I was shocked to see that that principals were in the room too (vice principal and real principal) They started to tell me how LB cheated on a big exam he had. I was crushed. 

LB and I had a long conversation about his future and actions. He was so sure he could turn his life around in 2 years, but he said that in grade 9.

I [23M] have something of a hefty backstory. My bio father left my mum while she was pregnant and idek who he is. She remarried when I was 3 to my stepfather and had my first sister a year later. Stepfather had always been cold towards me, but when his own kid was born, he basically decided he didn't want to raise someone else's child too and I got put into care. I was in and out of the care system (mostly in it) until I was 15, when I was graciously allowed back into my family home because I was grown up enough now that he wouldn't have to deal with me. 

Now, my time in care was awful. I'm sure you've all heard the horror stories about what hapems to kids in the system sometimes, and that I don't need to go into too much detail. Any time I saw my mum I would beg her to come home but he just simply wouldn't allow it. I grew a really intense feeling of resentment towards my stepfather, and I still have it because honestly, fuck him for making me go through that. 

Now the man is sick. It could be terminal, but he's receiving treatment so potentially not. Mum wants me to make ammends with him, just in case, but I've no interest in that. I've told her as much, and told her why. She keeps telling me to ""see his side"", like that makes it any better. He shoved me into the system because he's too proud to raise another man's child? What kind of a justification is that? Mum keeps talking about how difficult it was for him to have a child with a disability, which he does as my second sister has Down's syndrome, but that's also a bs justification because: 1. I'd already been in the system for *four years* when she was born and 2.

He's tried using the ""problem child"" excuse, and while it's true I acted out as a teenager, I believe that was a result of being in the system, not vice versa. 

TL;DR: my stepdad put me in care when my sister was born bc he didn't want to raise another man's kid now he had his own. Now he's sick and wants forgiveness but I still hold him responsible for the hellish experience I had in the system.",FALSE,FALSE,0,"Holding resentment towards your stepfather for his actions that led to significant emotional and possibly physical hardship during your childhood is understandable. Being placed in the care system, especially under such circumstances, can have profound and lasting effects. Your feelings are a natural response to what you experienced. While forgiveness can be a part of healing, it cannot be forced, and it is a personal journey. Your mother's request for you to make amends, although likely well-intentioned, overlooks the depth of the impact his actions had on you. Your emotional response is valid, and it's important for your feelings to be acknowledged and respected."
0,"AITA for being grumpy about crying babies interrupting date night dinner? | My SO and I went to dinner last night (Friday night) to a nicer establishment that doesn't close until midnight. We were sat after 9pm by 3 other tables that were empty at the time. Within 15 minutes two of the tables were sat and both had children less than a year old with them. Neither table were couples out for a nice evening together, they were both mom's with friends. Who were all very loud in conversation I should mention. 
Before we could get our main course both babies were crying and fussing very loud, and the mother's were both very inattentive. 
We get our food, order another glass of wine, and we finish quickly because we were both uncomfortable with the ear piercing screams surrounding us. 

I do not have children, so I understand how I can sound insensitive. Are Friday late night dinners no longer sacred? Is it socially acceptable to take your children into the cold of the night so you can blabber with your friends and ignore their cries publicly??? 


TLDR; Went to a later dinner and screaming babies ruined date night dinner. AITA? 

Edit:
This is a more upscale Italian food restaurant, not a chain. $25-$50ish plate. Our meal was $120 with 4 glasses of wine, and appetizer, and 2 entrees. No dessert. ",FALSE,TRUE,0,"Feeling frustrated by loud noises, such as crying babies, during a dinner at an upscale restaurant is a natural reaction. While children can be unpredictable, and parents may find it challenging to always control their behavior, it's understandable to expect a certain ambiance, especially in a finer dining establishment. However, expressing these feelings should be done respectfully, keeping in mind that parenting can be challenging and public spaces are shared by everyone, including families with young children."
0,I set a loud alarm to wake up my wife at the end of the nights sleep.,TRUE,FALSE,1,"Deliberately setting a loud alarm to wake someone up, especially if it's not necessary or if it disrupts their sleep, can be considered inconsiderate and disruptive. Sleep is important for health and well-being, and respecting each other's need for rest is important in a relationship. If the alarm is necessary for a specific reason, discussing this with your wife and finding a solution that works for both of you would be a more considerate approach."
